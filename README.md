# Harry Potter Spells 
## Purpose
To visualize which HP spells were the most common throughout the movie series, and to investigate which characters
cast the most spells. Regex, plotly, and jupyterdash did most of the heavy lifting.

## How to use
All data needed should flow in from this [github repo](https://github.com/devencentyk/datavisualization), however the files are available in the zip file just in case. 
You should be able to just tun the cells though and give the colab file one 'ctrl + -' to zoom out once for a better 
view of the dash app. 

If any issues arise when trying to run the .ipynb files, I've attached links to the google colab notebooks.
