# Harry Potter Spells 
## Purpose
To visualize which HP spells were the most common throughout the movie series, and to investigate which characters
cast the most spells. Regex, plotly, and jupyterdash did most of the heavy lifting.

## How to use
All data needed should flow in from this github repo. Just run the cells and give the colab file one 'ctrl + -' to zoom out once for a better 
view of the dash app.
